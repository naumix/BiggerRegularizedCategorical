# Bigger, Regularized, Categorical: High-Capacity Value Functions are Efficient Multi-Task Learners

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23150

This branch contains the implementation of the BRC algorithm.

## Example usage

To run the BRC algorithm in a single task mode, just pass a single task name to the `env_names` variable:

`python3 train.py --env_names=dog-run`

By passing a list of task names, multi-task mode will be enabled.
